# Technology Selection
Our team chose to use Java with the Spring framework because everyone in our team has prior experience using Java. Therefore, it was chosen because it was the language that everyone on our team had the most experience with.

We chose to use SQLite because it seems more appropriate for making a web server than using JSON. We also thought it would be a good skill to learn for future projects.
