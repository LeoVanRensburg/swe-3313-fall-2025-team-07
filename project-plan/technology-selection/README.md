# Technology Selection

### Language and Framework
Our team chose to use Java with the Spring framework because everyone in our team has prior experience using Java. Therefore, it was chosen because it was the language that everyone on our team had the most experience with.

### Storage
We chose to use SQLite because it seems more appropriate for making a web server than using JSON. We also thought it would be a good skill to learn for future projects. 

### Operating Environment
We will ensure that our code works on an Ubuntu 22.04 operating environment. 

### Necessary Software
The system will need Maven installed to build and use our software.
