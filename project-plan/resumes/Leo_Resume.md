## Work Experience
### Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, GA
**Research Assistant** - May 2025 – Present
- **Developed a Rust‑based automation** that orchestrated laptops to execute continuous test suites; the system detected Teams‑call drops and automatically re‑established the call, ensuring accurate testing results even with drops in internet connectivity.
- **Designed and deployed a full‑stack 5G testbed** on Ubuntu, integrating **Amarisoft‑eNB** and **Open5GS core** components; scripted automated provisioning, topology configuration, and traffic generation to validate end‑to‑end 5G performance for research payloads.
- **Implemented CI/CD pipelines** (GitLab) to automatically build, test, and deploy multiple projects, streamlining delivery and ensuring consistent quality across the codebase.
  
### Kennesaw State University Research Program, Kennesaw, GA
_Sep 2023 – Present_  
**First‑Year Scholars Program** – Sep 2023 – May 2024
- Led design and development of a novel Federated Learning (FL) testbed using CORE for simulated IoT environments with unstable network conditions.
- Presented research findings at the university's Spring Symposium of Scholars.
- Dedicated ~10 hours/week.
  
**Summer Undergraduate Research Program** – May 2024 – Jul 2024
- Expanded the FL testbed to support additional network topologies (e.g., Hierarchical FL) and integrated Grafana for real‑time performance visualization.
- Improved documentation, cutting onboarding time for new researchers by ~50%.
- Presented results at the Fall Symposium of Scholars to an audience of 20+ attendees.
- Dedicated ~40 hours/week.
  
**Sophomore Scholars Program** – Aug  2024 – May 2025
- Added 3+ attack vectors to evaluate vulnerabilities in FL algorithms and updated the consensus algorithm, reducing data loss during simulated attacks by 40%.
- Mentored four freshman students in testbed development.
- Preparing a technical paper summarizing the testbed's results (expected completion by spring semester).
- Dedicated ~10 hours/week.

## Projects
### Low‑Latency WireGuard Mesh Network
- Developed a WireGuard‑based mesh network that intelligently routes IP traffic for minimal latency across a fleet of VPSs in multiple cities.
- Designed and implemented an algorithm that selects optimal routing paths based on real‑time latency measurements, improving overall user latency by ~15%.
